## Our Philosophy

We have immense respect and appreciation for the contributions to Angular, both past and present. However, we believe that modernization and improvements don't mean losing the identity of Angular. We love the way Angular does things differently, and we aim to preserve that uniqueness while exploring new ways to enhance the developer experience.

## Why Angular Classic?

In a world where many frameworks are starting to look similar, we believe in the power of diversity. We want Angular to continue its unique approach, rather than incorporating syntax and features from other frameworks. While we believe in sharing features and drawing inspiration from other frameworks, including Google Angular, we are committed to preserving Angular's distinct identity.

## Tooling

For Angular Classic projects, we recommend using [Nx](https://nx.dev/). Nx offers all the benefits of Angular CLI, such as migration and schematics, without us having to maintain a separate CLI. You can use Nx with Angular Classic either as a standalone application or as an integrated repository.
