# NG-Classic

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of NG-Classic! We are a community of passionate developers who have decided to take a new path with Angular. This project is a hard fork of Angular, inspired by our love for the original framework and our disagreement with the direction Google has been taking it.

## Why NG-Classic?

In recent years, we've seen Google's Angular evolve into something different than what we initially fell in love with. We believe that Angular is no longer just Angular - it has become Angular Next. We've been drip-fed a whole new system that deviates far from the syntax and philosophy that made us choose Angular in the first place.

Our aim with NG-Classic is to keep Angular on the same path we've known and loved, with the same syntax and a better integration with RXJS. We believe that this will provide a more familiar and intuitive experience for developers who loved the original Angular.

## No More New Control Flow

In line with our philosophy of staying true to the original Angular, we have decided not to support the new control flow introduced in Angular Next. We believe that this new control flow complicates the simplicity and elegance of the original Angular syntax.

## Contributing to NG-Classic

We're excited to have you contribute to NG-Classic! We understand that the use of Bazel in Angular has been a barrier to many potential contributors. As such, one of our first steps in NG-Classic will be to remove Bazel and replace it with the much-loved NX. We believe that this will make it easier for developers to contribute to NG-Classic, and we look forward to seeing the wonderful things you'll build!

## Our Vision

We believe that by maintaining the essence of the original Angular, we can continue to provide a framework that is intuitive, elegant, and powerful. Our hope is that NG-Classic will become a welcoming home for all those who have loved working with Angular and wish to continue to do so.

We're excited to embark on this journey with you. Welcome to NG-Classic!
