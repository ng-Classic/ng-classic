# The ampersand declares an alias for an object, then later the `<<: *name`
# syntax dereferences it.

version: 2.1

# We don't want to include the current branch name in the cache key because that would prevent
# PRs from being able to restore the cache since the branch names are always different for PRs.
# The cache key should only consist of dynamic values that change whenever something in the
# cache changes. For example:
# 1) yarn lock file changes --> cached "node_modules" are different.
# 2) bazel repository definitions change --> cached bazel repositories are different.
# Windows needs its own cache key because binaries in node_modules are different.
# **NOTE 1 **: In order to avoid the cache from growing indefinitely and causing slow-downs, we invalidate the cache monthly.
#              (See https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012618473-Creating-a-daily-cache.)
# **NOTE 2 **: If you change the cache key prefix, also sync the cache_key_fallback to match.
# **NOTE 3 **: Keep the static part of the cache key as prefix to enable correct fallbacks.
# **NOTE 4 **: To make sure modified patches can be applied without needing to manually update the cache key,
#              the fallback cache key will not match if patches have been modified.
# See https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/#restoring-cache for how prefixes work in CircleCI.
