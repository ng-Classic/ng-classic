# Angular Classic styles

These styles are specific to the Angular Classic style guide.
Some have been imported from other style libraries and modified
to support the Angular Classic documentation style guide.

For styles imported from other libraries, the .vale.ini file
should disable the corresponding style in its original directory.
A copied style SHOULD NOT be removed from its original directory
to make it easier to identify changes to the original that can
then be manually copied to the Angular Classic version, if desired.
