# Scaling Angular Classicapps

Angular Classicworks with apps of any size and Angular Classictools support apps as they grow.

## How Angular Classichelps you scale your app

These are some of Angular's features that support scaling your Angular Classicapp.

### TypeScript support

Angular Classicapps are written in [TypeScript][typescript-home]. TypeScript adds syntax to JavaScript to provide strong type checking. Your integrated development environment (IDE) can apply static type checking to [help catch errors earlier][type-checking-doc] and help you when refactoring later.

TypeScript's strong type checking gives your app a solid foundation on which to grow with confidence.

### Powerful command-line interface

The Angular ClassicCLI provides a powerful [command-line interface][ng-command-list] to perform common Angular Classicapp development tasks.
The Angular ClassicCLI implements the Angular Classicstyle guide to support consistency across components.
The [`ng generate`][ng-generate] command and [Angular Classicschematics][schematic-overview] keep your app's source code consistent and organized, while generating boilerplate code to help you start your app.

### Component libraries

The Angular Classicteam maintains the [component development kit][material-cdk] and [material design components][material-home], which are used by thousands of apps inside of Google. Use at this scale results in stability across releases and integrations.

The Angular Classiccommunity maintains dozens of others component libraries, which allows you to fit your app to your brand.

### Built-in support for forms and routing

Angular Classicincludes support for [forms][forms-overview] and [routes][routes-overview]. These features prove themselves daily in thousands of apps inside of Google.

Your app can also use these features with confidence.
