# Scaling Angular Classic apps

Angular Classic works with apps of any size and Angular Classic tools support apps as they grow.

## How Angular Classic helps you scale your app

These are some of Angular's features that support scaling your Angular Classic app.

### TypeScript support

Angular Classic apps are written in [TypeScript][typescript-home]. TypeScript adds syntax to JavaScript to provide strong type checking. Your integrated development environment (IDE) can apply static type checking to [help catch errors earlier][type-checking-doc] and help you when refactoring later.

TypeScript's strong type checking gives your app a solid foundation on which to grow with confidence.

### Powerful command-line interface

The Angular Classic CLI provides a powerful [command-line interface][ng-command-list] to perform common Angular Classic app development tasks.
The Angular Classic CLI implements the Angular Classic style guide to support consistency across components.
The [`ng generate`][ng-generate] command and [Angular Classic schematics][schematic-overview] keep your app's source code consistent and organized, while generating boilerplate code to help you start your app.

### Component libraries

The Angular Classic team maintains the [component development kit][material-cdk] and [material design components][material-home], which are used by thousands of apps inside of Google. Use at this scale results in stability across releases and integrations.

The Angular Classic community maintains dozens of others component libraries, which allows you to fit your app to your brand.

### Built-in support for forms and routing

Angular Classic includes support for [forms][forms-overview] and [routes][routes-overview]. These features prove themselves daily in thousands of apps inside of Google.

Your app can also use these features with confidence.
